## But Does he really dominate against Australia ?

1. The Average run Virat Kohli scores whenever he score a ton against Australia is 125.1875 which is less than his overall average

2. Kohli gave his peak performance againdt Australia in 2013-2014 scoring 3 centuries each year that is total 6 of his 14 centuries in these two years came against Australia

3. Outof those 16 tons Kohli scores 9 of them in Australia and 7 of them are scored at home

<b><h2> So far apparently we can see Kohli pretty much dominates against Australia but did his centuries went in favour of India? </h2></b>

4. Outof those 16 tons against Australia only 6 of them ended in favour of India while in 7 of them India ended up loosing the match, as we have seen India lost only 14 match when Kohli scored a ton and now we see outof those 14, 50% are lost against the Ausies

<h2>How many of those 6 wins are in Australia ? </h2>

5. Out of those 6 wins 5 are at home and only one is at Austrailia. So the 7 centuries that Kohli scored at home 5 of them ended up in favour of India

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<b>Although Kohli scored 9 centuries against and in Australia but only 1 of them came in favour of India while in 5 of them India ended up loosing.
So the number of centuries may be high in Australia they were not as much impactful as they are at home

As an individual Kohli performed really well in Australia but team India did not get the expected result</b>
